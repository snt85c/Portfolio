tsParticles has been added as background effect on PresentationPage.tsx. the speed of the particles has been decreased to give a better effect, but it was noticed that it could cause lag issues.

useEffect now hve cleanup by using abortController.abort() on return

useRef has been added instead of useState to control isAlreadyVisited, as we dont want to trigger a re-render since it create issus with the motion.div ()

ScrollIcon are now static, as removing them can cause re-render
