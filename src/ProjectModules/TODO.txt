ui changes, changes interface iData details type from string to JSX.Element, fix lag in animation

linear gradient in projectModule moved to 180deg, in order to give a more homogeneous style to the background. the color now is diffused from the bottom (180deg), instead of coming from the side  

add data for Taskmanager

iData details has been changed from type string to type JSX.Element, this way im able to style the data how i want (eg: some words can be highlighted now)

lag in animation was detected and pinpointed to the TsParticles component. the numbers of prticle have ben halved from 80 to 40, as well as the fpsLimit brougt from 120 to 30. to keep some style on screen, particles.links.distance is now 200

animatePresence has been removed, as there is no need for it.
